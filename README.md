# Sean McCallum – Cybersecurity Career Transition (In Progress)

🇨🇦 Sarnia, Ontario | Remote-ready  
Actively pivoting 20+ years of sales/ops leadership into **cybersecurity & cloud security**.
Turning conversations into closed deals, now protecting data instead.

**Current focus (2025–2026)**  
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (active)  
- CompTIA Security+ → AWS cloud security certifications  
- Hands-on labs: TryHackMe, Qwiklabs, home SIEM builds  

**Strengths I’m bringing to the blue team**  
- Strong verbal & written communication - explaining complex ideas simply (mortgage rates to ransomware risks)  
- Customer focused problem solving – reading people fast, finding win-wins under pressure  
- Self directed learning & time management – full-time job + kids + mortgage + 10–15 hrs/week studying post-bedtime  

**Core values that drive me**  
- Protecting people and the businesses they depend on  
- Integrity first. Doing the right thing, even unseen (sales trust → security ethics)  

What excites me: Real people lose sleep over data/privacy threats. I've kept customers safe from bad buys for two decades. Now leveling up to stop bad actors.

Open to **junior/entry-level remote roles** in SOC, cloud security, security ops, or GRC.
