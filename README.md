- Hands-on practice: TryHackMe rooms, Qwiklabs, home SIEM builds (detection rules, vulnerability scans)  
- Python scripting for security tasks (log parsing, basic alerts)

### Strengths I’m Bringing to the Blue Team

- Strong verbal & written communication – Explaining complex ideas simply (from mortgage rates to ransomware risks)  
- Customer-focused problem solving – Reading situations/people fast, finding win-wins under pressure  
- Self-directed learning & time management – Balancing full-time job, family, and 10–15 hrs/week study (post-bedtime grind)

### Core Values That Drive Me

- Protecting people and the businesses they depend on  
- Integrity first – Doing the right thing, even when unseen (sales trust → security ethics)

What excites me: Real people lose sleep over data/privacy threats. I've kept customers safe from bad buys for two decades. Now leveling up to stop bad actors.
