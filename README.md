# Sean McCallum – Cybersecurity Career Transition (In Progress)

🇨🇦 Sarnia, Ontario | Single dad | Remote-ready  
Actively pivoting 20+ years of sales/ops leadership into **cybersecurity & cloud security**.

**Current focus (2025–2026)**  
- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate (active)  
- CompTIA Security+ → AWS cloud security certifications  
- Hands on labs: TryHackMe, Qwiklabs, home SIEM builds

**Strengths I’m bringing to the blue team**  
- Explaining complex things simply (20 years turning “no” into “yes” on high value deals)  
- Customer first problem solving under pressure  
- Rock-solid time management (full-time job + kids + mortgage + 10–15 hrs/week studying after 9 pm)

**Values that drive me**  
- Protecting people and the businesses they depend on  
- Doing the right thing even when no one is watching (integrity in sales translates directly to integrity in security)
- What excites me most about cybersecurity is simple: real people lose sleep when their data, money, or privacy is at risk. I’ve spent two decades keeping customers safe from bad purchases. Now I’m leveling up to keep them safe from bad actors.

Previous life (the proof I finish what I start):  
Top 10 % national sales performer (twice Circle of Excellence), store manager, P&L owner, realtor, and the guy who consistently posted the highest revenue growth in the mall.

Open to **junior / entry-level remote roles** in SOC, cloud security, security operations, or GRC especially with teams that value clear communication and real-world hustle.

Let’s connect — always learning, always shipping.
