# Sean McCallum

20+ years turning conversations into closed deals – from home theatres and cellphones to Kia EVs and houses in Sarnia, Ontario.  
I’ve managed stores, hit top-10% sales nationally (twice Circle of Excellence at Future Shop), and consistently delivered the highest revenue growth in my malls.

Now pivoting that same customer-first hustle into cybersecurity & cloud.  
Currently earning the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate → CompTIA Security+ → AWS path while still putting kids to bed and paying the mortgage.

I solve problems for people, whether it’s finding the perfect vehicle, the right house, or stopping the next ransomware attack.

**Open to junior / entry-level remote SOC analyst, cloud security, or security operations roles in Canada.**
